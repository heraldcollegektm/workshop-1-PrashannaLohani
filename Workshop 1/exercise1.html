<p><h4>Thomas John Watson Sr. was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM from February 17, 1874 to June 19, 1956. From 1914 through 1956, he led the company's expansion into an international powerhouse. From John Henry Patterson's training at NCR, Watson built IBM's managerial style and corporate culture. Using primarily punched card tabulating devices, he transformed the corporation into a highly effective selling organization. When he died in 1956, he was a leading self-made industrialist who was one of the wealthiest men of his day and was dubbed the world's finest salesman.</h4></p>
